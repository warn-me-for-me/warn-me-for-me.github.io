<!-- Clery Act -->
<div class="w3-container w3-light-grey" style="padding: 100px 16px 10px 16px" >
  <div class="w3-row-padding">
    <h1>Clery Act</h1>
      <p>The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (20 U.S.C. § 1092) was signed in 1990 after Jeanne Clery was raped and murdered on the Lehigh University campus. The Act mandated disclosure of campus crime statistics and was built on a philosophy that, had Jeanne Clery and her parents known the LU crime statistics, she would have gone to a different school. As stated in a program review by the Department of Education: the Clery Act is “based on the premise that students and employees are entitled to accurate and honest information about the realities of crime and other threats to their personal safety and the security of their property [1].” This legislation reflects a particular political moment as does it embed ideas about crime rates and crime prevention, etc.   
      </p>
      <p>Over the last 30+ years, little empirical data has been gathered regarding the effectiveness of the Act. One particular area of interest to our project is the student perceptions of the emergency notifications that UC Berkeley sends out in part in order to comply with a 2007 update to the Clery Act which was motivated by the Virginia Tech shooting. 
      </p>
<!-- Clery Geography -->
    <h3>Clery Geography</h3>
      <p>Each public university within the scope of the Clery Act has 4 categories of geography: on-campus, on-campus student housing, off campus, and public property. When we spoke to Abigail Ogden, Director of Clery Compliance at UC Berkeley, she noted the fuzzy boundaries on the map and that notifications will often be sent for incidents within and also just beyond the boundaries of Clery Geography. 
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, there are some interesting implications for coding of various campus-adjacent institutions as within or outside of Clery Geography. For example, if a certain fraternity ceases to be a recognized student organization due to disciplinary measures, it also ceases to be within Clery Geography.

    <h1>Clery @ UCB: WarnMe</h1>
      <p>UC Berkeley has an emergency notification system that consists of various parts including sirens, PA systems, UC Berkeley WarnMe, etc. The Everbridge mass notification system for UC Berkeley is branded as UC Berkeley WarnMe. Each message that is sent out is one of the following types: a timely notification, an emergency notification, or a community advisory. Each message type has its own protocol, notification method (email and text, or just email), and associated templates. Templates have varying levels of information and required components within the Clery Act.  </p>

<!-- Emergency Notifications -->
    <h3>Emergency Notifications</h3>
      <p>Emergency notifications are intended to let people know what is going on in the event of an emergency and how to respond. According to the 2023 Annual Security And Fire Safety Report, “[i]n the event that a significant emergency or dangerous situation occurs, UC Berkeley will; (1) confirm the existence of a significant emergency or dangerous situation; (2) determine the appropriate segment or segments of the campus community to notify; (3) determine the content of the emergency notification; and (4) initiate the emergency notification system.” [2] Additionally, followup notifications are often sent to communicate when the emergency or threat is a longer active (“all clear”). </p>

<!-- Timely Warnings -->
    <h3>Timely Warnings</h3>
      <p>Unlikely emergency notifications, timely warnings are those aimed at prevention.</p>

<!-- Community Advisories -->
    <h3>Community Advisories</h3>
      <p>Add small note about these: that they are at the discretion of the college and are not subject to any clery review.</p>
