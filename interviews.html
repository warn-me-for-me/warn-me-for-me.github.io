    <h2>Exploratory Interviews</h2>
      <p>Exploratory interviews were conducted with three goals in mind. We wanted to interview students at other universities and colleges to understand the user needs of a university emergency alert system, identify the user pain points and hurdles with their current university’s emergency alert system, and learn about any improvements they would like to see in their own systems. Three people were interviewed that attended a liberal arts school (with approximately 1,500 students) and two state schools (with approximately 6,400 students and 42,000 students).
      </p>
        <!-- Interpretation and Emotional Impact -->
        <h4>Interviewees</h4>
        <p>The first interviewee described their emergency alert system as “intuitive” as their school provides a school-wide app to receive emergency notifications and can adjust the way they receive notifications in their settings. They can communicate in the app through a direct messaging feature to submit tips about an incident (connected to a computer), receive summaries about an incident, and see pictures and a campus map. They use the app frequently and believe that their school is prompt in giving notifications and updating; however, they do mute notifications for incidents they deem “smaller.” Improvements they believe could be useful to their system include: more resources and safety tips through text messages in addition to notifications from the app, link to connect to someone through the app when an incident happens, and more useful information about what you should do when a type of incident occurs.    
        </p>
        <p>The second interviewee reported that their emergency alert system was an app that they described, “looked like social media.” It has different categories of posts and you can curate your feed to be subscribed to different topics, such as campus security alerts, student information, campus resources, classes currently enrolled in, etc. They stated that navigating is relatively easy, but it took them time to get used to using it and was initially confused as to where to find the campus safety information. As far as promptness, the interviewee stated that they often hear about incidents from other people before hearing officially from the school through the app and that emails about incidents that occur at night aren’t sent out until the next morning. Improvements they believe could be useful to their system include: emergency notification alerts should be prioritized to be at the top of the feed because it is easy for campus security notifications to get lost in the feed because you have to scroll to find them and you should be able to get text messages and emails in addition to notifications on the app.  
        </p>
        <p>The third interviewee detailed their emergency alert system to be through email, text messages, or phone calls. They receive all forms of notifications and note that with the phone calls, they receive an automated call that also leaves a voicemail if they don’t pick up and can be transcribed by their phone. They described their alert system as “less useful” as they don’t have any idea where to update their information or notification settings and there were incidents on campus when they knew something was happening, heard from other students, and did not receive any notifications about the incident. Improvements they believe could be useful to their system: a place to give feedback on the system, a way to see where incidents have happened on a map, number of times an incident has happened in a given time, pictures (or rough sketches) if they know details about the perpetrator, and more accurate descriptions instead of “someone from x residential hall.”   
        </p>
        <p>All interviewees expressed questions about their current university’s emergency alert system. They wanted to know what departments controlled the alert system, is there a dedicated person who sends out alerts that they need to wait for or can anyone in the department send it, where you could ask questions or give suggestions, why response times for incidents are varied, and how they pick and choose which alerts to send out.
